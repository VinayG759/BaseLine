# Baseline API contract (version 2)

Shared by backend/ and web/. Change it only after both of you agree.

Two endpoints, one response shape. **Version 2** adds the `lang` setting.

**endpoints**

```
GET  {API}/api/trends?person_id=amma&lang=kn
     → the person's history, nothing uploaded

POST {API}/api/reports
     multipart/form-data:
       person_id    text, required, matches ^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$
       file         image/jpeg or image/png, required, at most 4 MB
       report_date  YYYY-MM-DD, optional (overrides the date read off the report)
       lang         en | kn | hi, optional
     → reads the report, saves it, returns the person's full history

lang   language of the "summary" sentence only. en = English, kn = Kannada, hi = Hindi.
       Optional on both endpoints; missing means en. Anything else is a 400.
```

**both return 200 with this shape**

```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `order` | Out-of-range results first (high or low), then the longest streak, then alphabetical by name. |
| `errors` | Any non-200 carries `{"error": "a sentence a person can act on"}`. The page shows that sentence as-is, so write it for a human. |
| `language` | Only `summary` is translated. Test names, units, numbers and dates are always returned exactly as printed on the report, whatever the language. If translation fails, `summary` comes back in English; the page doesn’t need to handle that specially. |
| `people` | Fixed list on the page: `amma`, `appa`, `me`. No accounts, no login. |
